# Hello-World
First Repository


Hello fellow computer people, my name is Alexander Turner.
I'm currently in school two semesters away from recieving my B.S. in Computer Science.
I enjoy a wide range of computer programming topics, from Javafx applications to Emulators, and game engines.
I hope I can produce programs that people will find uses for in the future. - Nov. 7th 2017 (First Commit).
